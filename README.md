# README for Dev

## Initial commit

The initial commit for dev contains the python notebook, with developer comments inline.  In future builds, developer comments will be attached as a timestamped and version-stamped README on Github. 

Alpha python notebooks will retain the usage of all developer comments being inline, since the alpha branch may have multiple sub-projects.
