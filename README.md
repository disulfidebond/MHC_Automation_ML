# README

## Setup
There are three main branches for development: 
* alpha
  * This is the branch that is actively under development for the any upcoming release. It may contain partial commits, segments of notebooks, or full builds. Use files from here at your own risk; they should be considered unstable.
* beta
  * This is the branch that is stable.  At this point, there is no distinction between beta and release. It usually will consist of a single python notebook, and a README.md description file.
* dev
  * This is branch that is undergoing active development for the next beta release.  It may contain multiple files, but usaully will contain a single python notebook with developer comments relating to the next beta build.

See the README.md in each branch for more information.
