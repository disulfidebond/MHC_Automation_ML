# README for Dev

## Initial commit

The initial commit for dev contains the python notebook, with developer comments inline.  In future builds, developer comments will be attached as a timestamped and version-stamped README on Github. 

Alpha python notebooks will retain the usage of all developer comments being inline, since the alpha branch may have multiple sub-projects.

The dev version for the release contains comments embedded within the code, whereas the beta fork has most of the comments removed.

The next version, beta 1_1, will address the following:
* replace patch in code with a more stable implementation (see commented section near #PRAGMA Mark: formatDataStructure)
* output will be a pivot_table and not separate files
* requests for changes and any other bugfixes that were missed

The following version, beta 1_2 **will be a major change**.  The beta 1_2 version will implement a Neural Network (abbreviated 'NN'), which will build on the existing data structure and workflow in beta 1_0 and beta 1_1. I will also be working closesly with Dave Baker to standardize and organize data within LabKey, which is essential for operation of the NN and hitting the target accuracy of 99%.
