# README for Beta

## Initial commit

The initial commit for beta contains the python notebook. Without exception, this and all future releases in the beta branch will be fully functional python notebooks, which can be immediately downloaded and used by researchers at the O'Connor Lab and Genetics Services.  

README files that accompany the beta builds will mainly consist of general usage comments, general advisories, and general statements on future builds.  The Dev Branch README will have specific and technical information on the python notebook and its functionality.
